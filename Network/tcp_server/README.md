# TCP Server and Client in Python

This project demonstrates a simple TCP server and client implementation using Python's built-in `socket` module. The server listens for incoming connections, receives data from the client, and sends a response back. The client sends data to the server and waits for a response.

## Features
- The TCP server can handle multiple client connections sequentially.
- The client can send messages to the server and receive responses in real-time.
- Basic interaction through the console (terminal).

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- No external libraries required (uses Python's `socket` module).

## Usage

```bash

# Open a terminal and run
python ./server.py

# Open another terminal and run
python ./client.py
```
