## 🔧 Technical Design

### 1. 🌐 **Network Tools**

- 🕵️‍♂️ **Network Scanning**: Discover live hosts, open ports, and services on remote machines using IP ranges and service fingerprinting.
- 🧰 **Brute Force Tools**: Recursive web directory brute force utilities to uncover hidden directories and files on web servers.
- 🔬 **Packet Analysis**: Capture and analyze network traffic, providing detailed insights into network protocols and vulnerabilities.

### 2. 💻 **Linux Tools**

- 📝 **Log Parsing**: Automated parsing of critical system logs (`syslog`, `auth.log`) to detect security breaches or operational failures.
- 📊 **Performance Monitoring**: Tools for tracking system resource usage, identifying bottlenecks, and optimizing system performance.
- 🔄 **Port and Service Monitoring**: Monitor port states and detect changes in service availability.

---

## 🌐 Network Design Principles

- ⚡ **Efficiency**: Uses multithreaded processing for faster execution of network scans, packet capture, and service monitoring.
- 🔗 **Modularity**: The tools are modular, meaning they can be used independently or integrated into larger automation workflows.
- 📈 **Scalability**: Designed to work in both small-scale environments and larger enterprise setups with complex network topologies.
